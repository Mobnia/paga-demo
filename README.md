# [Paga] API Demo for Startup Weekend Lagos

## [Paga] API
[Paga] provides the [Paga Connect] API which enables developers integrate the [Paga] payment platform into their applications.

## Demo
This demo uses the [Paga Connect] API to allow users pay for products with either a Verve, Visa or Master Card.
This use case is especially useful when providing payment options for users who may not have a paga account.

## Other Use Cases
The card payment option is by no means the only option available via the [Paga Connect] platform.
With a proper Oauth 2 flow completed, it is possible to perform more operations which include:
 * Making Payments into a Merchants Account
 * Checking The User's Balance
 * Transferring Money to the User's Paga Wallet
etc.

For a full list of the available options check the  [Paga Connect] documentation.
